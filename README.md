# Burger 

[The-Burger](https://burgermayb3.herokuapp.com/) is a Burger App using Node.js and Express Web Frameworks, Handlebars and ORM. Users can order new burgers in the input field and then "grub them". The App logs all burgers ordered and grubbed. It uses MySQL to query and route data to the App and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
